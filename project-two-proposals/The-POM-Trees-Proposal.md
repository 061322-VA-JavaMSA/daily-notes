# The POM Trees Project 2 Proposal

We are making a blogging app where users can make new blog posts and also see weather info based on their location. A basic user can make posts and edit/delete them, and moderators can delete other users' posts if they are against the terms of service. Upon signing up, a user will input their location, which is how the app will know what weather information to populate whenever they login.

## User stories:
- Users can sign up as a basic user - Users sign up with username, password, email? and city name or zip code
- Users can login
- Users can log out
- Users can post new blog posts
- Users can edit their blog posts
- Users can delete their blog posts
- Mods can delete other users' posts
- Users can view all blog posts
- Users can view the time and time zone of when a blog post was posted
- Users can view the temperature and time of day of their location after logging in
- Users can view/edit their profile

## Stretch goals:
- Users can favorite other blog posts
- Users can view their favorites
- Mods can ban users
